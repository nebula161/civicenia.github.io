Senator MrJeremyFisher invoked Article 1 of the Hansard Act

> **Article 1:** Should a Senator feel that a non-constitutional law passed by the Senate is no longer relevant, such as a treaty with a bygone nation, that Senator is permitted to request the President, within plain-view of the Senate, to nullify the law. Should the President approve the request, the law is made null and void, as if repealed.

to repeal the Treaty for Temporal Independence and the Temporal Vault Treaty, which was approved by President ChrisChrispie.
